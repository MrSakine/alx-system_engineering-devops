#### Create a RSA key pair
Requirements:
  -Share your public key in your answer file 0-RSA_public_key.pub
  - Fill the SSH public key field of your intranet profile with the public key you just generated
  - Keep the private key to yourself in a secure location, you will use it later to connect to your servers using SSH. Some storing ideas are - - Dropbox, Google Drive, password manager, USB key. Failing to do so will prevent you to access your servers, which will prevent you from doing your projects
