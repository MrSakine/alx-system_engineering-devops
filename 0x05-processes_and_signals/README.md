# 0x05. Processes and signals

## Learning Objectives
  - What is a PID
  - What is a process
  - How to find a processâ€™ PID
  - How to kill a process
  - What is a signal
  - What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

## Tasks
### 0-what-is-my-pid
a Bash script that displays its own PID

### 1-list_your_processes
a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes

### 2-show_your_bash_pid
a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process

### 3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy
a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash

### 4-to_infinity_and_beyond
a Bash script that displays `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely

### 5-dont_stop_me_now
a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process

### 6-stop_me_if_you_can
a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process

### 7-highlander, 67-stop_me_if_you_can
Write a Bash script that displays:
  - `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely
  - With a `sleep 2` in between each iteration
  - `I am invincible!!!` when receiving a `SIGTERM` signal

Make a copy of your `6-stop_me_if_you_can` script, name it `67-stop_me_if_you_can`, that kills the `7-highlander` process instead of the `4-to_infinity_and_beyond one`

### 8-beheaded_process
a Bash script that kills the process `7-highlander`

### 100-process_and_pid_file
a Bash script that:
  - Creates the file `/var/run/myscript.pid` containing its PID
  - Displays `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely
  - Displays `I hate the kill command` when receiving a SIGTERM signal
  - Displays `Y U no love me?!` when receiving a SIGINT signal
  - Deletes the file `/var/run/myscript.pid` and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal

### 101-manage_my_process, manage_my_process
Write Bash (init) script `101-manage_my_process` that manages `manage_my_process`. (both files need to be pushed to git)
When passing the argument start:
  - Starts `manage_my_process`
  - Creates a file containing its PID in `/var/run/my_process.pid`
  - Displays `manage_my_process` started
When passing the argument stop:
  - Stops `manage_my_process`
  - Deletes the file `/var/run/my_process.pid`
  - Displays `manage_my_process` stopped
When passing the argument restart
  - Stops `manage_my_process`
  - Deletes the file `/var/run/my_process.pid`
  - Starts `manage_my_process`
  - Creates a file containing its PID in `/var/run/my_process.pid`
  - Displays `manage_my_process` restarted
Displays `Usage: manage_my_process {start|stop|restart}` if any other argument or no argument is passed
